I can't let go of these broken thoughts
I wanna hit the road, how could I go on
I'm on my own, I'm a lonely soul
Like the holy ghost that had left alone

You know how I feel
You know how to heal me
You know how I feel
You know how to heal me

I want the Acura, then I'll drive away
From my little brain, I swear I hate that place
Acura, then I'll drive away
From my little brain, I swear I hate that place

I want the Acura, then I'll drive away
From my little brain, I swear I hate that place
Acura, then I'll drive away
From my little brain, I swear I hate that place

You know how I feel
You know how to heal me
You know how I feel
You know how to heal me
